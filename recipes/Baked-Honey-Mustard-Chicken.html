                        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon dried parsley</li>
                    </ul>
            
            <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F 
                        (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with 
                        cooking spray.</li>
                    <li>Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Place in the 
                        prepared baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Combine honey, mustard, basil, paprika, and parsley in a small bowl; mix well. 
                        Pour 1/2 of the honey mustard mixture over chicken and brush to cover.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn chicken pieces over and brush 
                        with remaining honey mustard mixture. Continue baking until chicken is no longer 
                        pink and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer 
                        inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Let chicken rest for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
